## Integrate with Strobe

Learn how to set up Strobe Protocol locally and deploy your first zero-knowledge proof application.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Strobe contracts">
    First, install the Strobe Protocol contracts using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install @strobelabs/contracts
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import Strobe interface">
    At the top of your Solidity file, import the IStrobeCore interface:
    ```solidity
    pragma solidity ^0.8.25;
    import {IStrobeCore} from "@strobelabs/contracts/src/core/interfaces/IStrobeCore.sol";
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define the contract">
    Start by declaring the StrobeCore interface:
    ```solidity
      contract ExampleApp {
        IStrobeCore private strobeCore = IStrobeCore(strobeCoreAddress);

        event ProofRequested(uint256 requestId);
        event ProofVerified(uint256 requestId, bool success);
      }
      ```
      This sets up the basic structure and initializes the StrobeCore interface in the constructor.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Requesting and Verifying Proofs

<Steps>
  <Step title="Implement proof request function">
    Add a function to request proofs:
    ```solidity
    function requestProof(address verifierAddress, string memory ipfsHash) external {
        uint256 requestId = strobeCore.requestProof(address(this), verifierAddress, ipfsHash);
        emit ProofRequested(requestId);
    }
    ```
    This function allows your contract to request proofs through Strobe Protocol.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement verification callback">
    Add a callback function for proof verification:
    ```solidity
    function onVerify(bool success, uint256 requestId) external {
        require(msg.sender == address(strobeCore), "Only StrobeCore can call this function");
        emit ProofVerified(requestId, success);
    }
    ```
    This function will be called by StrobeCore when a proof is verified.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Deploy your application

To deploy your contract:
<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up environment variables">
    Create a `.env` file with your private key and RPC URL:
    ```
    PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
    SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_rpc_url_here
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy the contract">
    Use Forge to deploy your contract:
    ```bash
    forge create --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY src/ExampleApp.sol:ExampleApp --constructor-args $STROBE_CORE_ADDRESS
    ```
    Replace `$STROBE_CORE_ADDRESS` with the actual address of the StrobeCore contract on Sepolia.
  </Step>
</Steps>
