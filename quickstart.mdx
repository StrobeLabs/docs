## Setup your development environment

Learn how to set up Strobe Protocol locally and deploy your first zero-knowledge proof application.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Initialize a new project">
    Create a new Foundry project with Strobe Protocol:
    ```bash
    forge init my-strobe-app
    cd my-strobe-app
    
    ```
    This will create a new directory with a basic Foundry setup and install the Strobe Protocol contracts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Install Strobe library">
    Install strobe contracts to interface with teh strobe netwrok. 
    ```bash
    npm install @strobelabs/contracts
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Develop

Create a new file `src/ExampleApp.sol` and add the following content:
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.25;
import {IStrobeCore} from "strobelabs/contracts/src/core/interfaces/IStrobeCore.sol";

contract ExampleApp {
    IStrobeCore private strobeCore;

    event ProofRequested(uint256 requestId);
    event ProofVerified(uint256 requestId, bool success);

    constructor(address strobeCoreAddress) {
        strobeCore = IStrobeCore(strobeCoreAddress);
    }

    function requestProof(address verifierAddress, string memory ipfsHash) external {
        uint256 requestId = strobeCore.requestProof(address(this), verifierAddress, ipfsHash);
        emit ProofRequested(requestId);
    }

    function onVerify(bool success, uint256 requestId) external {
        require(msg.sender == address(strobeCore), "Only StrobeCore can call this function");
        emit ProofVerified(requestId, success);
    }
}
```
This contract demonstrates basic interaction with Strobe Protocol, including requesting and verifying proofs.

Deploy your application
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Deploy to Sepolia testnet">
    To deploy your contract to Sepolia, first create a `.env` file with your private key and RPC URL:
    ```
    PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
    SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_rpc_url_here
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    forge create --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY src/ExampleApp.sol:ExampleApp --constructor-args $STROBE_CORE_ADDRESS
    ```
    Replace `$STROBE_CORE_ADDRESS` with the actual address of the StrobeCore contract on Sepolia.
