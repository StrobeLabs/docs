## Introduction

ZK-Ownable is an extension of the standard Ownable contract, enhanced with zero-knowledge proof verification for claiming ownership. This approach allows the ownership of a contract to be transferred securely based on privacy-preserving proofs, adding a new layer of security and flexibility.

**Use Cases**

- Secure ownership transfers using zero-knowledge proofs
- Privacy-preserving contract ownership mechanisms
- Enforcing off-chain logic or conditions before ownership changes

## Example Usage: SetNumber Contract

Here is an example contract, `SetNumber`, which inherits from `ZKOwnable`. The contract allows only the owner to update the stored number.

```solidity
import "@strobelabs/contracts/templates/ZKOwnable.sol";

contract SetNumber is ZKOwnable {
    uint256 public number;

    constructor(
        address strobeCoreAddress,
        address initialOwner,
        address initialVerifier,
        uint256 initialNumber
    )
        ZKOwnable(strobeCoreAddress, initialOwner, initialVerifier)
    {
        number = initialNumber;
    }

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) external onlyOwner {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function getNumber() external view returns (uint256) {
        return number;
    }
}
```
