## Introduction

ZK-Ownable is an extension of the standard Ownable contract, enhanced with zero-knowledge proof verification for claiming ownership. This approach allows the ownership of a contract to be transferred securely based on privacy-preserving proofs, adding a new layer of security and flexibility.

**Use Cases**

- Secure ownership transfers using zero-knowledge proofs
- Privacy-preserving contract ownership mechanisms
- Enforcing off-chain logic or conditions before ownership changes

## Step-by-Step Guide

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Circuit and Verifier">
    1. Visit [registry-dev.zkregex.com](https://registry-dev.zkregex.com).
    2. Use the interface to create your desired circuit.
    3. Generate the corresponding verifier.
    4. Note down the verifier address provided by the platform - we will refer to this as the "original verifier". 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Install Strobe contracts">
    Install the Strobe Protocol contracts using npm:
    ```bash
    npm install @strobelabs/contracts
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create ProofTypeZKEmail Verifier">
    Create a new contract that extends the ProofTypeZKEmail adapter:

    ```solidity
    import "@strobelabs/contracts/src/proof-types/ProofTypeZKEmail.sol";

    contract MyVerifier is ProofTypeZKEmail {
        constructor(address originalVerifier, uint256 inputSize) ProofTypeZKEmail(originalVerifier, inputSize) {}
    }
    ```

    Replace `originalVerifier` with the address noted in Step 1.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy Verifiers">
    1. Deploy the original verifier (if not already deployed by the registry).
    2. Deploy your `MyVerifier` contract, passing the original verifier's address.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create A Contract">
    Create your smart contract which you want to add ZK-Ownable to:
    ```solidity
    import "@strobelabs/contracts/src/templates/ZKOwnable.sol";

    contract MyContract is ZKOwnable {
        constructor(
        address strobeCoreAddress,
        address initialOwner,
        address initialVerifier
    )
        ZKOwnable(strobeCoreAddress, initialOwner, initialVerifier) {}
    }
    ```

    1. `0xB3E387886b0Bf305d166470F032e3ED89CD95F96` is the Strobe Core contract.
    2. `initialOwner` is the first owner of your contract.
    3. `initialVerifier` is the verifier that is used to check eligibility to claim ownership.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy ZK-Ownable Contract">
    Deploy `MyContract`, passing in the address of the contract's first owner and the address of the `MyVerifier` contract.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Adding onlyOwner">
    Since we extended `ZKOwnable.sol`, we can gate functions using the `onlyOwner` modifier and allow users to claim ownership given a valid proof using `claimOwnership`. We can even allow new owners to change the verifier address required to claim ownership with `setOwnershipVerifier`. These features are included with the `ZK-Ownable` template that we extended.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Example Usage: SetNumber Contract

Here is an example contract, `SetNumber`, which inherits from `ZKOwnable`. The contract allows only the owner to update the stored number.

```solidity
import "@strobelabs/contracts/templates/ZKOwnable.sol";

contract SetNumber is ZKOwnable {
    uint256 public number;

    constructor(
        address strobeCoreAddress,
        address initialOwner,
        address initialVerifier,
        uint256 initialNumber
    )
        ZKOwnable(strobeCoreAddress, initialOwner, initialVerifier)
    {
        number = initialNumber;
    }

    function setNumber(uint256 newNumber) external onlyOwner {
        number = newNumber;
    }

    function getNumber() external view returns (uint256) {
        return number;
    }
}
```
