## What is Strobe Protocol?

Strobe Protocol is a comprehensive framework for managing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) on blockchain networks. It provides a set of smart contracts and tools that enable developers to easily integrate ZKP functionality into their decentralized applications (dApps).

## Core Primitives

Strobe Protocol is built around three fundamental operations:

  </Card>

## How It Works

Strobe Protocol leverages several key components to provide a flexible and powerful framework for zero-knowledge proof integration:

**ERC257: Standardized Verifier Interface**

At the core of Strobe Protocol is ERC257, a standard interface for zero-knowledge proof verifiers. This standard allows for seamless integration of various types of verifiers, ensuring interoperability across different ZKP systems. Developers can create custom adapters for different types of zero-knowledge proof systems, allowing dApps to work with a wide range of ZKP technologies.

    D -->|5. Result| C
    C -->|6. Result| B
    B -->|7. Result| A
```

## Key Features

- **Decentralized:** Runs entirely on-chain, leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain networks.
- **Flexible:** Supports various types of zero-knowledge proofs and verifiers.
- **Interoperable:** Can be easily integrated with existing smart contracts and dApps.
- **Efficient:** Optimized for gas usage and performance.
- **Extensible:** Allows for the creation of custom verifier adapters to support new ZKP systems.

## Use Cases

dApps can integrate Strobe Protocol and its verifiers in various ways, depending on their specific use cases:

1. **Prediction Markets:** Utilize ZK-email proofs to resolve outcomes in decentralized prediction markets.
2. **ZK-ERC20 Tokens:** Create tokens that can only be minted by providing a valid zero-knowledge proof.
3. **Identity Verification:** Implement privacy-preserving identity checks using ZKPs.
4. **Confidential Transactions:** Enable private transactions with selective disclosure using ZKPs.
