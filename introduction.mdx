## What is Strobe Protocol?

Strobe Protocol is a comprehensive framework for managing zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) on blockchain networks. It provides a set of smart contracts and tools that enable developers to easily integrate ZKP functionality into their decentralized applications (dApps).

## Core Primitives

Strobe Protocol is built around three fundamental operations:

    Initiate a request for a specific zero-knowledge proof

    href="/core-concepts/submitting-proofs"
  >
    Directly submit and verify proofs without a prior request
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It Works

1. **Requesting Proofs:** Applications can request specific zero-knowledge proofs by calling the `requestProof` function on the StrobeCore contract. This function takes:
    1. A callback address (where the verification result will be sent)
    1. A verifier address (the contract that will verify the proof)
    1. An IPFS hash (pointing to the proof requirements)

2. **Fulfilling Proof Requests:** Provers can fulfill these requests by calling the fulfillProofRequest function, providing:
    1. The request ID 
    1. The generated proof
    1. The proof inputs

3. **Submitting Proofs:** For direct proof submission without a prior request, the `submitProof` function can be used, taking:
    1. The verifier address
    1. The proof
    1. The proof inputs

## Key Features

- **Decentralized:** Runs entirely on-chain, leveraging the security and transparency of blockchain networks.
- **Flexible:** Supports various types of zero-knowledge proofs and verifiers.
- **Interoperable:** Can be easily integrated with existing smart contracts and dApps.
- **Efficient:** Optimized for gas usage and performance.

## Example Usage

Here's a simple example of how to interact with the Strobe Protocol:

```solidity
import {IStrobeCore} from "@strobelabs/contracts/src/core/interfaces/IStrobeCore.sol";

contract ExampleApp {
    IStrobeCore private strobeCore;

    constructor(address strobeCoreAddress) {
        strobeCore = IStrobeCore(strobeCoreAddress);
    }

    function requestProof(address verifierAddress, string memory ipfsHash) external {
        uint256 requestId = strobeCore.requestProof(address(this), verifierAddress, ipfsHash);
    }

    function onVerify(bool success, uint256 requestId) external {
        require(msg.sender == address(strobeCore), "Only StrobeCore can call this function");
        // Logic upon successful verification
    }
}
```
